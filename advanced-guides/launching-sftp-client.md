# Launching SFTP Client

There's 2 Apps for SFTP in MagmaNode.

1. FileZilla (Less Customization but more advanced?)
2. WinCP (More Customization)

You can use Any.

First go to your FTP panel, Open the Settings tab, you'll see your SFTP Username and Host



Launch FileZilla/WinCP and Put The Username and the Host, now it wants a Password, the password is just the password you used to Log-in/Register to your account



Now you can upload/Download big files
